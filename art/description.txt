Triples is very similar to the classic card game Set, except you don't need to carry a deck of special cards with you everywhere!  The rules of the game are very simple: find triples of three cards where each property is either the same for all three cards or different for all three cards.

There are two game modes available:
 - Classic: go through the entire deck
 - Arcade: find as many in one minute

Extra care has been taken to provide a simple, beautiful and fluid experience.

The game currently features timekeeping and records of all previous games as well an interactive description of the rules.
